Lazarev is a full-stack web platform designed to revitalize local economies and communities by connecting residents who have unique skills with others who need them, all within a localized, trustworthy environment. In rapidly growing urban areas, unique abilities often go unused, while residents struggle to find verified, local help. Lazarev solves this by offering a streamlined, geo-located platform for skill exchange, micro-consulting, and collaborative projects.
